# Revisiting-ML (Goal: Revising concepts of AI/ML, NLP and GEN-AI)
Logs of ML concepts that am revising each day.


Day1- Completed Decision Trees adding the notes and codes from scratch and using different libraries.


Day2- Completed Logistic Regression in a detailed way adding notes along with the code example.


Day3- Completed Random Forest along with its code and made a project on Decision Trees.


Day4- Completed SVM and KNN also added their notes and codes.


Day5- Completed K means clustering, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost with notes and codes also made a project on SVM (Stroke Prediction using SVM).


Day6- Worked with RNN and its mathematics, created notes of the same.


Day7- Learnt LSTM in very detail and created its notes along with the code template.


Day8- Solely worked on internship tasks (AWS database)


Day9- Statrted working on transformers and its mathematics.


Day10- Completed Transformers and also created its notes.


Day11- Completed Auto encoders and published itt's notes


Day12,Day13- Completed Boltzmann machines and its types in very detail (making notes of the same) and also viewed the uses of Autoencoders and Boltzmann Machines in space of GEN-AI.










Topics I skipped unintentionally (I would cover them later): 
PCA, Types of loss functions and the gradient algorithms, Regression
